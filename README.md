## Keywords

Section #, as well as any words that quickly give your peers insights into the application like programming language, development platform, type of application, etc.

## Project Abstract

This document proposes a novel application of a text message (SMS or Email) read-out and hands-free call interacted between an Android Smartphone and an infotainment platform (headunit) in a car environment. When a phone receives an SMS or Email, the text message is transferred from the phone to the headunit through a Bluetooth connection. On the headunit, user can control which and when the received SMS or E-mail to be read out through the in-vehicle audio system. The user may press one button on the headunit to activate the hands-free feature to call back the SMS sender.

## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

## Features and Requirements

# Functional Requirements

1. User must have an account to play on CodeBattlegrounds
    - They will be prompted to sign-in with Google
    - User will be authenticated through google Oauth

2. User must be able to interact with matchmaking
    - Start the search for matchmaking
    - Exit matchmaking

3. Coding Questions
    - The application will include a database of coding questions for users to answer.
    - The questions will include
        - Strings
        - Arrays
        - Trees
        - Math Questions
        - Data Structures & Algorithms

4. Question Process
    - The application will follow a structured flow
        - Users will be paired
        - Users will be assigned a random question from the question list
        - The coder will have to submit code to answer the question
        - the QA participant will need to create feedback and create test cases
        - QA Participant can send these test cases to the coder

# System Overview

# Project Abstract
The purpose of this document is to present the proposal for an interactive Web Application that combines the benefits of gamification and collaboration to help develop teamwork in programming. The application allows Users to team up with a partner to solve coding problems within a time limit, promoting problem-solving skills, teamwork and collaboration skills. Once Users create accounts, they will each assume the role that consist of either coding or writing test cases, and they shall work together to brainstorm and implement solutions, iteratively coding and testing to ensure correctness in their code. Through the use of this Application, Users will see improved timeliness, collaborative skills, and overall coding performance.
